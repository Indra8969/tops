        //drawback of declaring a mothods direcly 
        /*
        1. Memory consumption
            every time when we create an instance of the method every single time the new copy of that method is created that why it  takes more memory
        2.  
            due to the repeated creating of the identicle function it       cunsumption of memry and perfomance will be impacted
        3. 
            no prototypical inheritance : methods which are  directly declared in the obnjects are not the part of the prototype chaain this means that you lose out on js prototypical ingerutance,
