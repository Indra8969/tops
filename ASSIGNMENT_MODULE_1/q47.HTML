            Arrays vs Objects
                Structure:
                    Array: Ordered collection with numeric indices.
                    Object: Collection of key-value pairs with string or Symbol keys.
                    
                Access:
                    Array: Accessed by numeric indices (e.g., arr[0]).
                    Object: Accessed by keys (e.g., obj['key'] or obj.key).

                Order:
                    Array: Maintains order of elements.
                    Object: Key order is not guaranteed (though modern JavaScript engines generally preserve insertion order for string keys).
                    
                Length Property:
                    Array: Has a length property indicating the number of elements.
                    Object: Does not have a length property; use Object.keys(obj).length to get the number of properties.
                    
                Use Cases:
                    Array: Ideal for lists or sequences where order and index-based access are important.
                    Object: Ideal for representing entities with named properties and attributes.
